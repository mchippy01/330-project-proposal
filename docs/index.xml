        <italic>Reburn and Return: How Invasive Species Influence Fire
  Return Intervals in Colorado.</italic>

  Motivation</bold>
        </underline>
      </p>
      <p>Invasive plants and forest fires are significant issues in
  Colorado. Fire intensity and frequency, as well as the dominance of
  invasive species  are increasing in Colorado.   Invasions by
  non-native plant species after fire can negatively impact important
  ecosystem services and lead to invasion-fire cycles, which ultimately
  further degrade ecosystems Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  . Invasive species have negative impacts on ecosystems not limited to
  fire return intervals. Some of these impacts are disruption of species
  interactions, impact on successional recovery, introduction and spread
  of diseases, reduction in native species diversity, and economic
  losses Gallardo, Clavero, Sánchez, &amp; Vilà
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-gallardo2016global" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). </p>
      <p>Certain invasive species can alter fire frequencies and
  intensities, potentially increasing the occurrence of wildfires
  Gallardo et al.
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-gallardo2016global" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>)
  . The influence of non-native species on forest fire regimes is
  complex and varies by vegetative functional type and geographic region
  Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  This project will examine how different functional groups of invasive
  species impact fire return intervals, re-establishment rates, and
  expansion across Colorado. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, it has been established that native  species rely on
  soil microbiomes to establish on burned soil, while non-native do not;
  this makes non-natives more likely to establish quickly after forest
  fires and then dominate these disturbed sites Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  However, scientific understanding of how to restore plant-soil
  microbiome interactions after wildfires remains limited, leading to a
  key knowledge gap in post- fire ecosystem restoration Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Escobedo’s research was done in a greenhouse in Chile, measuring
  establishment of native vs. non-native species in burned , unburned,
  and burned soil that was inoculated with native microbiome species
  Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). 
  The study found that burned soil had higher levels of available
  nutrients, which benefited non-native species Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Furthermore, this study found that native species relied on the native
  microbiome while non-natives did not Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Taking this study into account, once we see what invasive species are
  an issue in Colorado relating to fire intervals, and then use
  information about plant-soil microbiome interactions from Escobedo to
  see if this interaction could be furthering the issue. We are not sure
  exactly how this information will be used, but since it is relevant,
  we want to keep the option open to explore it. It is likely outside
  the scope of our research, but we are open to including it if we can
  find a way to.</p>
      <p> In this project, we will compare eight burned sites across
  Colorado that have experienced wildfires within the past 20 years.
  Sites will be selected to represent a range of geographic regions and
  burn severities, enabling analysis of how different conditions
  influence invasive species dynamics. In addition, two unburned sites
  serving as control locations will be selected from areas with no
  recorded wildfires during the same period. This site selection
  strategy aims to capture variability in post-fire plant communities
  and better understand the relationship between invasive species
  re-establishment risk and fire severity. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The main dataset we will be using is current and future projection
  post-ire invasion risk by non-native short lived forbs and grasses
  Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  This data is based on vegetation cover data from plots in the Western
  U.S that burned prior to sampling. Projected invasion risks post-fire
  were calculated using random forests with gridded climate, topographic
  predictor, and soil variables by Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  .We will use the data projected under a high emission scenario. </p>
      <p>We will also use data from the USFS from 2005 that tracks invasive
  species prominence
  ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/fia-datamart">https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/fia-datamart</ext-link>
  ). We will compare a total of 10 sites in Colorado that we will
  compare, trying to spread our sites out geographically and by severity
  of burn. We will pick sites that had been surveyed in 2005 and are
  also included in the projection data. </p>
      <p>Our projection data is in a spatial format, so we will need to
  extract data from longitude and latitude of the sites we select. We
  will also need data that shows fires in Colorado going back to at
  least 2005 that will include fire severity. </p>
      <p>In order to see where our spatial data and historic data overlap ,
  we had to take several steps. First I had to find a secondary dataset
  from the USFS that had latitude and longitude. Then, I preformed an
  innerjoin to get location information assigned to the sites:</p>
      <p>Next I had to get the data to show as points on a map:</p>
      <p>{r} r =
  rast(“/Users/chippymarx/Downloads/sl_forb_current.tiff”)</p>
      <p>pts = Invasive_withLoc %&gt;% st_as_sf(coords = c(“LON”, ‘LAT’),
  crs = 4326)</p>
      <p>if (interactive()) { mapview::mapview(pts) }</p>
      <p>I was then able to get this visualization:</p>
      <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="img/USFSdataonmap.png"/>
      <p>Next I had to limit the spatial data to Colorado :</p>
      <p>Extract raster values at point locations and save them to a new
  column:</p>
      <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="index_files/figure-jats/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png"/>
      <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="img/rastercroppedtoCO.png"/>
      <p>That produced the above image which is the spatial data showing
  forb invasion risk in Colorado.</p>
      <p>Then to get them to overlay eachother, I did these steps :</p>
      <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="index_files/figure-jats/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png"/>
      <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="img/overlayingdata.png"/>
      <p>I am still trying to learn how to work with spatial data and need
  some additional help with getting to a testing phase, but will be in
  office hours tomorrow.</p>
      <p>
        <underline>
          <bold>Methods</bold>
        </underline>
      </p>
      <p>The first test we will run will be to model the influence of a
  functional group of invasive species to see how that affects the
  projection for fire and an invasive return interval. We will try out
  several models including a linear regression, random forest, and
  Xgboost. We will also use a Bayesian model to get uncertainty
  estimates and a more flexible hierarchical structure to represent
  random effects for the region or species. We will find the best model
  and then we can use that to make projection predictions for sites that
  we don’t have projection data for.  </p>
      <p>The second test we will run is an ANOVA test. With this test we
  will see if the mean invasion risk across our sights vary
  significantly. We could also potentially see if the risk of forbs or
  grasses are significantly different. We could also use this test to
  see if different burn severitys lead to different invasion risk. </p>
      <p>I believe that we have all the data we need for this project
  between our two datasets. One piece of supplemental data that might be
  useful  is data showing forest fires in Colorado. This would allow us
  to explore urn severity and its correlation to invasion risk. I think
  GIS or another form of spatial data would be ideal for this, but we
  are not sure if we will be able to do this on top of the other goals
  we have outlined.</p>
      <p>A potential challenge is that our historic data counts invasive
  species, while the projection data projects invasion risk. Therefore
  we are going to have to figure out a way to make the two different
  types of data comparable. I think that a visualization of invasive
  cover could be useful and might help to bridge that gap. </p>
      <p>Along with handling spatial data, we also grapple with how we carry
  out our approaches. In addition to ANOVA, linear regression, random
  forest, and XGBoost models will be used to assess associations between
  fire severity, vegetation cover, and invasion threat. These models
  will inform us of linear and non-linear relationships and allow us to
  assess predictive performance. Spatial autocorrelation is also an
  issue as it could affect results if areas close to one another are too
  alike each other. Finally, as invasion and fire are persistent
  processes, it could be difficult to see evident patterns with
  predominantly new data, and therefore model calibration and validation
  would be an important part of our methodology.</p>
      <p>The methods including ANOVA and learning models like random forest
  and XGBoost, will enable us to identify the most important predictors
  of invasive species spread and their effects on fire return intervals.
  Using a suite of methods, we will assess the extent to which different
  factors—like fire severity and region—drive invasion risk and enable
  us to predict future invasive species patterns across Colorado. We
  hope to apply these methods to improve our knowledge of how invasive
  species are altering fire return intervals and ecosystem health,
  guiding management and restoration.</p>

  . The influence of non-native species on forest fire regimes is
  complex and varies by vegetative functional type and geographic region
  Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  This project will examine how different functional groups of invasive
  species impact fire return intervals, re-establishment rates, and
  expansion across Colorado. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, it has been established that native  species rely on
  soil microbiomes to establish on burned soil, while non-native do not;
  this makes non-natives more likely to establish quickly after forest
  fires and then dominate these disturbed sites Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  However, scientific understanding of how to restore plant-soil
  microbiome interactions after wildfires remains limited, leading to a
  key knowledge gap in post- fire ecosystem restoration Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Escobedo’s research was done in a greenhouse in Chile, measuring
  establishment of native vs. non-native species in burned , unburned,
  and burned soil that was inoculated with native microbiome species
  Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>). 
  The study found that burned soil had higher levels of available
  nutrients, which benefited non-native species Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Furthermore, this study found that native species relied on the native
  microbiome while non-natives did not Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  Taking this study into account, once we see what invasive species are
  an issue in Colorado relating to fire intervals, and then use
  information about plant-soil microbiome interactions from Escobedo to
  see if this interaction could be furthering the issue. We are not sure
  exactly how this information will be used, but since it is relevant,
  we want to keep the option open to explore it. It is likely outside
  the scope of our research, but we are open to including it if we can
  find a way to.</p>
        <p> In this project, we will compare eight burned sites across
  Colorado that have experienced wildfires within the past 20 years.
  Sites will be selected to represent a range of geographic regions and
  burn severities, enabling analysis of how different conditions
  influence invasive species dynamics. In addition, two unburned sites
  serving as control locations will be selected from areas with no
  recorded wildfires during the same period. This site selection
  strategy aims to capture variability in post-fire plant communities
  and better understand the relationship between invasive species
  re-establishment risk and fire severity. </p>

        <p>The main dataset we will be using is current and future projection
  post-ire invasion risk by non-native short lived forbs and grasses
  Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  This data is based on vegetation cover data from plots in the Western
  U.S that burned prior to sampling. Projected invasion risks post-fire
  were calculated using random forests with gridded climate, topographic
  predictor, and soil variables by Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  .We will use the data projected under a high emission scenario. </p>
        <p>We will also use data from the USFS from 2005 that tracks invasive
  species prominence
  ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/fia-datamart">https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/fia-datamart</ext-link>
  ). We will compare a total of 10 sites in Colorado that we will
  compare, trying to spread our sites out geographically and by severity
  of burn. We will pick sites that had been surveyed in 2005 and are
  also included in the projection data. </p>
        <p>Our projection data is in a spatial format, so we will need to
  extract data from longitude and latitude of the sites we select. We
  will also need data that shows fires in Colorado going back to at
  least 2005 that will include fire severity. </p>
        <p>In order to see where our spatial data and historic data overlap ,
  we had to take several steps. First I had to find a secondary dataset
  from the USFS that had latitude and longitude. Then, I preformed an
  innerjoin to get location information assigned to the sites:</p>

        <p>I am still trying to learn how to work with spatial data and need
  some additional help with getting to a testing phase, but will be in
  office hours tomorrow.</p>
        <p>
          <underline>
            <bold>Methods</bold>
          </underline>
        </p>
        <p>The first test we will run will be to model the influence of a
  functional group of invasive species to see how that affects the
  projection for fire and an invasive return interval. We will try out
  several models including a linear regression, random forest, and
  Xgboost. We will also use a Bayesian model to get uncertainty
  estimates and a more flexible hierarchical structure to represent
  random effects for the region or species. We will find the best model
  and then we can use that to make projection predictions for sites that
  we don’t have projection data for.  </p>
        <p>The second test we will run is an ANOVA test. With this test we
  will see if the mean invasion risk across our sights vary
  significantly. We could also potentially see if the risk of forbs or
  grasses are significantly different. We could also use this test to
  see if different burn severitys lead to different invasion risk. </p>
        <p>I believe that we have all the data we need for this project
  between our two datasets. One piece of supplemental data that might be
  useful  is data showing forest fires in Colorado. This would allow us
  to explore urn severity and its correlation to invasion risk. I think
  GIS or another form of spatial data would be ideal for this, but we
  are not sure if we will be able to do this on top of the other goals
  we have outlined.</p>
        <p>A potential challenge is that our historic data counts invasive
  species, while the projection data projects invasion risk. Therefore
  we are going to have to figure out a way to make the two different
  types of data comparable. I think that a visualization of invasive
  cover could be useful and might help to bridge that gap. </p>
        <p>Along with handling spatial data, we also grapple with how we carry
  out our approaches. In addition to ANOVA, linear regression, random
  forest, and XGBoost models will be used to assess associations between
  fire severity, vegetation cover, and invasion threat. These models
  will inform us of linear and non-linear relationships and allow us to
  assess predictive performance. Spatial autocorrelation is also an
  issue as it could affect results if areas close to one another are too
  alike each other. Finally, as invasion and fire are persistent
  processes, it could be difficult to see evident patterns with
  predominantly new data, and therefore model calibration and validation
  would be an important part of our methodology.</p>
        <p>The methods including ANOVA and learning models like random forest
  and XGBoost, will enable us to identify the most important predictors
  of invasive species spread and their effects on fire return intervals.
  Using a suite of methods, we will assess the extent to which different
  factors—like fire severity and region—drive invasion risk and enable
  us to predict future invasive species patterns across Colorado. We
  hope to apply these methods to improve our knowledge of how invasive
  species are altering fire return intervals and ecosystem health,
  guiding management and restoration.</p>

        <title>Idea #1: Carbon storage changes under climate change.</title>
        <p><bold>Research Question</bold>: How does changing climatic
  conditions affect forest fire projections and carbon storage In the
  Colorado over the next 5 years?</p>
        <p><bold>Justification</bold>:</p>
        <p>Wildfires are affected by climate change, and extreme fires are
  becoming more frequent due to increased drought, reduced humidity and
  soil moisture, and changing temperature Wu et al.
  (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-wu2023uncertainty-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>)
  . This poses a risk to carbon sequestration by forests, as more
  extreme fires release stored carbon from these forests; yet in some
  areas carbon storage is still predicted to increase Shmuel, Lazebnik,
  Glickman, Heifetz, &amp; Price
  (<xref alt="2025" rid="ref-shmuel2025global-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>)
  . In Colorado, forest fire is a relevant and important topic, therefor
  I want to scale data on climate and fire projections and then use that
  to predict carbon storage changes in Colorado over the next 5 years.
  This topic is ultimately important because changes in carbon
  sequestration greatly influence climate change, creating a feedback
  loop; as fires increase more carbon is on the atmosphere, increasing
  the effects of climate change, and therefor increasing fire potential
  Burton et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-burton2024fire-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  . Fires are currently a threat to global climate change and emission
  goals because of the loss of carbon in forests, which increases the
  carbon in the atmosphere Burton et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-burton2024fire-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).</p>
        <p><bold>Methods</bold>:</p>
        <p>For the analysis of this question, I will use the drought and
  wildfire data that includes temperature, soil moisture, humidity, wind
  speed and fuel availability data
  (https://www.drought.gov/topics/fire). I will use multivariate
  statistics tests such as an ANOVA test to see how different climatic
  conditions and fire interact. I will use the climate and fire
  projections Shmuel et al.
  (<xref alt="2025" rid="ref-shmuel2025global-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2025</xref>)
  and land cover data for the west (from MRLC) to predict carbon storage
  change over the next 5 years. I will use the paper “Uncertainty in US
  forest carbon storage potential due to climate risks” to establish the
  relationship between fire and carbon storage loss Wu et al.
  (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-wu2023uncertainty-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).
  This paper also has useful information for my calculations and
  conversions. I will also use data “Fire weakens land carbon sinks
  before 1.5 °C” Burton et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-burton2024fire-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  to strengthen the connection between fire and carbon storage. I think
  that I will know more specifically how I will use them when I dig into
  the data, but for now I think they are both good resources to have.
  Ultimately, I will run correlation tests to see how the climatic
  variables interact with fire and my carbon storage projections.</p>
        <p>Expected Outcome: I expect that due to increasingly aray climatic
  conditions, carbon storage will decrease in Colorado in the next 5
  years</p>

        <title>Idea #2: Invasive plant- forest fire feedback loop.</title>
        <p><bold>Research Question</bold>: How do non-native plants effect
  fire regimes and maintain dominance in Colorado? Justification:
  Invasive plants and forest fires are significant issues in Western US.
  Invasions by non-native plant species after fire can negatively impact
  important ecosystem services and lead to invasion-fire cycles, which
  ultimately further degrade ecosystems Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  The impact of non-natives on forest fires is complex and can vary
  between vegetative functional type and geographic region Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  . It has been established that native woody species rely on soil
  microbiomes to establish on burned soil, while non-native do not; this
  makes non-natives more likely to establish quickly after forest fires
  and then dominate these disturbed sites Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  However, scientific understanding of how to restore plant-soil
  microbiome interactions after wildfires remains limited, leading to a
  key knowledge gap in post- fire ecosystem restoration Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  This topic is ultimately important because it can inform management
  decisions on how to treat and restore areas pre and post fire in the
  arid west.</p>
        <p><bold>Methods:</bold> To answer this question, I will use the
  projections of post fire cover non-native and short-lived species
  under current and future climate conditions to create a baseline of
  what invasions will look like in the future Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  . I will then use the information and data of different geographic
  regions and vegetative functional type to analyze how the different
  projected invasions will affect forest fire in the future Prevéy et
  al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  I will use data from a study done in greenhouses that assesses
  nonnative and native plant survival post fire across different
  vegetative functional types in order to show how the different
  functional types of plants native to Colorado may be affected by fire
  Escobedo et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-escobedo2024native-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>).
  For the functional types of native species in Colorado I will use FIA
  data from the USDA to show trends (
  https://research.fs.usda.gov/products/dataandtools/tools/fia-datamart)
  . I will also use past wildfire data which is available from the
  article Prevéy et al.
  (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-prevey2024non-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)
  to show any correlation between functional plant group type and past
  forest fires.</p>
        <p>Expected outcome: I expect that my research will show a increase in
  the invasives-fire feedback loop in Colorado, and that native plant
  distribution will decrease.</p>

        <title>Idea #3 : How Rising Temperatures Change Snowmelt
  Timing</title>
        <p><bold>Justification:</bold> Snowmelt in alpine areas is a major
  water source for plants, animals and people. With climate change,
  warmer temperatures are causing snow to melt earlier Musselman, Clark,
  Liu, Ikeda, &amp; Rasmussen
  (<xref alt="2017" rid="ref-musselman2017-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>)
  . This can disrupt ecosystems and lead to water shortages downstream
  Climate Change (IPCC)
  (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-ipcc2021-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).
  Understanding these changes can help us plan for water use and protect
  alpine habitats.s.</p>
        <p><bold>Research Question</bold>: How does warming temperature affect
  when snow melts in alpine areas? Hypothesis: Warmer temperatures cause
  snow to melt earlier, shortening the snow season.</p>
        <p><bold>Proposed Methods:</bold> We’ll use snowpack data ( NOAA
  snowpack data) and temperature data ( from PRISM) for alpine regions
  in the Western U.S. Snowmelt timing will be tracked from 1980 to 2020,
  and we’ll look for trends linking higher temperatures to earlier
  snowmelt.</p>
        <p><bold>Expected Outcomes:</bold> We expect to see snow melting
  earlier as temperatures rise. This could lead to less water for
  ecosystems and people, showing the need for better water planning.</p>

      <sec id="idea-4-fire-recovery-in-coastal-shrublands-nb-1">
        <title>Idea #4 : Fire Recovery in Coastal Shrublands</title>
        <p><bold>Justification:</bold> Coastal shrublands are built to handle
  fire but frequent more intense fires from climate change could push
  them past their limit Keeley &amp; Syphard
  (<xref alt="2016" rid="ref-keeley2016-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) .
  Studying how shrubs regenerate after fire especially under tough
  conditions like drought can help us manage and protect them better
  Enright, Fontaine, Lamont, Miller, &amp; Westcott
  (<xref alt="2015" rid="ref-enright2015-nb-1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p>
        <p><bold>Research Question</bold>: How do fire severity and rainfall
  affect shrubland regeneration? Hypothesis: Higher fire severity and
  less rainfall mean slower regeneration.</p>
        <p><bold>Proposed Methods</bold>: We’ll combine fire data with climate
  data to study post-fire regrowth in California shrublands. Vegetation
  recovery could be tracked from satellite images. We’ll use statistical
  models to figure out how fire and rainfall affect regeneration.</p>
        <p><bold>Expected Outcomes</bold>: Shrublands hit by severe fires and
  low rainfall will show slower recovery. These findings can guide
  better fire management and restoration planning.</p>
